# Yandex Algorithms 1.0 hw1-4 

I'm glad to say that I've done half the work. It is interesting to note that repositories are created to facilitate the exchange of knowledge between programmers; However, as a beginner, I don't have any exceptional accomplishments to showcase. Therefore, I will simply share my impressions that I encountered while solving tasks.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what to write, so I'll try to limit my answer to three key topics related to the contest

1) Entry difficulty

The input system in the platform is significantly different from the basic functions that beginners typically learn. For instance, in the commonly used "fmt" package, the "fmt.scan(&_)" function does not work as intended, but unfortunately, the system only provides a compilation error, and it is impossible to determine what went wrong. Furthermore, seeking technical support useless because Yandex contest is a platform for publishing contests and  just not suppose to offer assistance with understanding how to use it.

I was lucky that for the first four homework there were ready-made solutions on the Internet, and later it was easy for me to figure out how to take the first steps. It's amusing that there are simply no more golang codes and I will be glad to post them myself in the future if everything goes well

2) Lack of error explanation

On one hand, it may seem illogical to expect any clues or assistance using a competitive platform. On the other hand, Yandex Algorithms pos itself as an educational, and after a year of tasks solutions being available, it is reasonable to expect feedback indicating which specific tests the code did not pass. Errors may stem from simple oversights to a fundamental misunderstanding.

If the user's code differs from the solution, he may assume that his way of thinking was wrong from very beginning. This can happen even after extensive testing of their code with a variety of inputs, including sample inputs, native test cases, edge cases, and null inputs.

3) Time and memory limits

At the beginning of each task, there is a plate with established restrictions on the code run time and memory weight. But basically, if your code is working, then it will always fit the restrictions. Maybe for some kind of inefficient programming language, you really need to get tired of speeding it up, but as I guess, there is simply no such thing.

At first glance, it may seem convenient that users only need to focus on coding without worrying about other factors. However, this approach may lead to future difficulties for beginners who desire to learn programming without relying on excessive lines of code or loops. Although it may not be possible to create a complex three-star rating system due to the differing speeds of various programming languages, it would be beneficial for users to have a sense of how fast their code could potentially be, as well as a benchmark to strive for.

Overall, Yandex Algorithms is an excellent collection of tasks, and I am pleased that I continued my studies with them. While it is disappointing that I began my journey so late, it is still preferable to start late than not at all, especially since my education is related to management, which values work experience more than skills. In the repository, I will also include a folder containing tasks that resulted in wrong answers or runtime errors, despite i still can not identify them :( . I do not believe it is necessary to share correct solutions, as they are already available on GitHub. (I will do this for future hws, the golang answers to which are simply nowhere to be found)
